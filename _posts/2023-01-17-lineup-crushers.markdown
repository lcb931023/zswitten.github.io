[This is a post about basketball.]

There are a lot of ways to be good at defense. You can protect the rim, you can pressure the ball, you can make smart rotations and disrupt passing lanes. But there's another way to prevent the other team from scoring that no one talks about. It's one that players like Zion Williamson, Nikola Jokic, and Steven Adams excel at. And the crazy part is, you can do it before the game's even started.

I'm talking about affecting the other team's lineup. Players with unique offensive skillsets, like a Zion or a Jokic, run roughshod over most potential defenders, to the point that opposing coaches are willing to put offensive liabilities on the court just to give their teams a shot to guard these guys.

This isn't just theoretical. This is an effect we can measure. The money stat is the gap between your defensive rating, which measures how many points per possession your team gives up while you're on the floor vs. when you're off the floor, and your DRPM, which measures the same thing but adjusts for which players your opponent has in the game when you're playing.

I'm now going to pull the stats for the last three seasons and rank everyone by the ratio between their DEFRTG and their DRPM. I swear I wrote everything you've read so far before looking at the data -- my hypothesis is Zion, great offensive rebounders like a Steven Adams, and maybe some really zippy point guards like Trae will do well here, and we may see a reverse effect as well where players who are total nonfactors on offense hurt their DEFRTG by letting the other team get away with playing bad defenders.
