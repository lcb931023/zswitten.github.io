I got curious about the simplifications and abstractions that we collectively inflicted on neurological models of the brain in order to arrive at what we today call "neural networks". I ordered & am reading a textbook called [Principles of Neurobiology](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neurobiology-Liqun-Luo/dp/0815344945/), by Liqun Luo. Below please find chapter-grouped blog posts with the facts that I found most surprising and divergent from how artificial neural networks work.
